# Front-end-projects

This is a repo for front-end practice projects. While I already have some experience with python and html/css/javascript. Most of the projects were unstructured or only small scripts and/or subject to previous employees intellectual property.
Here I take a more structured approach while also expanding my skillset to include the use of Github, npm a front-end framework (in this case React).

The goal is finish projects within 1-3 weeks by creating minimal viable products (MVP's). With this approach, the focus is on learning and improving, not on finishing polished products.



Currently working on a fullstack Supabase/Next.js webshop integrated with Mollie payments. Will upload to a public repo when MVP is finished.
