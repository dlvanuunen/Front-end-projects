# Front-end-projects

This is a repo for front-end practice projects. While I already have some experience with python and html/css/javascript. Most of the projects were unstructured or only small scripts and/or subject to previous employees intellectual property.
Here I take a more structured approach while also expanding my skillset to include the use of Github, npm and a front-end framework (in this case React).

The goal is finish projects within 1-3 weeks by creating minimal viable products (MVP's). With this approach, the focus is on learning and improving, not on finishing polished products.

Descriptions:

Project 0: Setup and Github test.
Project 1: Simple counter app with increase/decrease buttons.
Project 2: Simple to-do list app.
Project 3: Anime Finder App: fetches data from an API to display anime movies and series in a card based layout.
Project 4: Rebuild a landingpage design from scratch (Focus on CSS).
Project 5: Luchtmeetnet dashboard: fetch data from api and display most recent values in cards and a graph of the past days. (W.I.P)

Preview: Full page screenshot of the projects.






Currently also working on a fullstack Supabase/Next.js webshop integrated with Mollie payments. Will upload to a public repo when MVP is finished.
