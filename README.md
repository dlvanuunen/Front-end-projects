# Front-end-projects

This is a repo for front-end practice projects. While I already have some experience with python and html/css/javascript. Most of the projects were unstructured or only small scripts and/or subject to previous employees intellectual property.
Here I take a more structured approach while also expanding my skillset to include the use of Github, npm a front-end framework (in this case React).

The goal is finish projects within a week (or 2 for larger ones) by creating minimal viable products (MVP's). With this approach, the focus is on learning and improving, not on finishing polished products.

Potential future projects:
  - Learn data visualisation with D3 and react. => Dashboard.
  - Learn user interactions and rendering by building a simple Go app (the chess like boardgame).
  - Learn navigation/routing and expand on css foundations by building either a portfolio website or webshop.
